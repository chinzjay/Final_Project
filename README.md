### Topic:

### Technologies:
So far in this segment we used Excel and Python to clean the data. We also started a machine learning model on Jupyter Notebooks. We're attempting to use machine learning to answer questions about the type of tourism in different countries. 

### Week 1 task assignments:
Robert: Circle role - Data cleaning.

Chinnu: Triangle role - Started the machine learning model.

Loulwa: Square role - Repository and took notes and updated the README.md file + presentation.
